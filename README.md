# CDN w/Node.js
Let's make CDN yourself!

# How it works?
Cloudflare Cache is serve files from CF CDN Server.

So I made this repo. You can use as Simple&Lightweight File Server or Fast&LightWeight CDN Server!

# How to install?
1. clone this repo (`$git clone https://github.com/TeamSekai/Sekai.CDN.git`)
2. install package (`$npm i` or `$yarn install`)
> If you wanna use yarn, you need install yarn. (`$npm i -g yarn`)
3. edit `config.json` (copy `config.json.example` as `config.json`)
4. build with `$yarn build`
5. run server (`$yarn start` or `$pm2 start yarn -- start`)

Done! default port is 8080. you can view page on `http://localhost:8080`.

# Cache files w/Cloudflare
